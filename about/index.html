      <p id="aboutText">Hello and welcome to my website!<br>

        If you came to learn something about me, you came to the right place.
        If not, well stay for a bit and maybe you’ll learn something.<br>

        My name is Ayush B. Agarwal and I live in Algonquin, Illinois.
        My wonderful family includes my Mother, Father, and younger Sister.
        I have spent most of my life living in curiosity.
        As a young child, my curiosity led me to develop a passion for LEGOs
        and Origami till I was in 8th grade. The countless LEGOs buildings
        such as the Lego Taj Mahal and London Bridge taught me how patience
        and commitment are needed to complete any task. Origami brought about
         several other life-long lessons, most importantly, Modularity. From
         creating simple cranes and shapes to using multiple sheets of paper
         to create a larger and more complex structures, modular origami changed
         my life.<br>

         All these traits provided an enormous change in my life when I met
        the world of Computer Programming. I decided to try a small online
        course to learn Java when I was in 8th grade and surprising I learned
        a lot from my past experiences. From there, my interest in programming
        nearly skyrocketed. In 9th grade, I wanted to further my Math and
        Science skills, so I decided to apply to the Illinois Mathematics and
        Science Academy (IMSA) in Aurora, IL. It’s a selective residential
        high school geared towards students who excel in Math and Science. I
        am very thankful for the three years that I spent away from home at
        IMSA because of the knowledge that I gained. It was where I learned to
        understand myself and more so, my capabilities. At IMSA I was able to
        engage in Independent Study opportunities and do breakthrough Research
        that other high school students do not receive.<br>

      I spent three years at IMSA taking difficult classes and learning
        new concepts that I will carry with me for the rest of my life. I
        took advanced classes in Math such as Theory of Analysis, a calculus
        proof-based class, Differential Equations, and Multi-Variable Calculus.
        However, in addition to the classes research became a big part of my
        life at IMSA. After Sophomore year, I applied to a research group with
        Dr. Peter Dong and Dr. Lenny Spiegel in the field of Particle Physics,
        and after my Junior year, I interned at Worldpay Inc.<br>

      Outside of School and Programming, I love to play sports, dance,
        and spend time in the community. I have played competitive Golf for
        about 7 years now and was part of the Varsity Team at IMSA. I also
        enjoy dancing at Indian functions hosted both at my school and in my
        community in various different styles. I also enjoy teaching math and
        science to young children in my community which I have been doing for
        the past 2-3 years in Algonquin, IL as well as volunteering at the
        local donation center, Home of the Sparrow.<br>

      This website is my way to share stories about myself and write about
        what I’ve learned so far in my life. If you enjoyed the content or
        would like to talk to me in more detail about some of my experiences,
        feel free to contact me or visit my LinkedIn profile. Don’t feel
        intimidated, I’m just a very friendly and somewhat shy 18 year old
        boy!</p>
