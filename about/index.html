        <h1>Hello and welcome to my website!</h1>

        <p>If you came to learn something about me, you came to the right place.
        If not, well stay for a bit and maybe you’ll learn something.
        </p>

        <p>
        My name is Ayush B. Agarwal and I live in Algonquin, Illinois.
        My wonderful family includes my Mother, Father, and younger Sister.
        I have spent most of my life living in curiosity.
        As a young child, my curiosity led me to develop a passion for LEGOs
        and Origami till I was in 8th grade. The countless LEGOs buildings
        such as the Lego Taj Mahal and London Bridge taught me how patience
        and commitment are needed to complete any task. Origami brought about
        several other life-long lessons, most importantly, modularity. From
        creating simple cranes and shapes to using multiple sheets of paper
        to create a larger and more complex structures, modular origami changed
        my life.
        </p>

        <p>
        All these traits provided an enormous change in my life when I met
        the world of Computer Programming. I decided to try a small online
        course to learn <b>Java</b> when I was in 8th grade, and surprisingly, I learned
        a lot from my past experiences. From there, my interest in programming
        nearly skyrocketed. As a Freshman in High School, I wanted to further
        my Math and Science skills, so I decided to apply to the

        <a href="https://www.imsa.edu/">Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy</a>

        (IMSA) in Aurora, IL. It’s a selective residential
        high school geared towards students who excel in Math and Science. I
        am very thankful for the three years that I spent away from home at
        IMSA because of the knowledge that I gained. It was where I learned to
        understand myself and more so, my capabilities. At IMSA I was able to
        engage in Independent Study opportunities and do breakthrough

        <a href="../experiences/index.html">Research</a>

        that other high school students do not receive.
        </p>

        <p>
        I spent three years at IMSA taking difficult classes and learning
        new concepts that I will carry with me for the rest of my life. I
        took advanced classes in Math such as Theory of Analysis, a calculus
        proof-based class, Differential Equations, and Multi-Variable Calculus.
        However, in addition to the classes research became a big part of my
        life at IMSA. After Sophomore year, I applied to a research group with
        Dr. Peter Dong and Dr. Lenny Spiegel in the field of Particle Physics
        at the

        <a href="http://fnal.gov/">Fermilab National Particle Accelerator Laboratory</a>

        (FNAL), and after my Junior year, I interned at

        <p>
        Outside of School and Programming, I love to play sports, dance,
        and spend time in the community. I have played competitive Golf for
        about 7 years now and was part of the Varsity Team at IMSA. I also
        enjoy dancing at Indian functions hosted both at my school and in my
        community in various different styles. I also enjoy teaching math and
        science to young children in my community which I have been doing for
        the past 2-3 years in Algonquin, IL as well as volunteering at the
        local donation center,
